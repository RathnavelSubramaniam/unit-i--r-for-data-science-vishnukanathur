## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
question 1
What happens if you make a scatterplot of class versus drv? Why is the plot not useful?
```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg)+
  geom_point(aes(x=class,y=drv))
```
Answer: the plot is not useful because the variable drv and class are categorical variable

Question 2
What’s gone wrong with this code? Why are the points not blue?


```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg)+
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy,color="blue"))
```

Answer: the point are not in blue color because the parameter color is included with aesthetic the point in blue color 

```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg)+
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy),color="blue")
```

question 3
a) What happens if you map a aesthetic to something other than a variable name,like aes(colour = displ< 5)?

```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg)+
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy,color=displ<5))
```

Answer: 
ggplot(data=mpg)+
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy,color=displ<5))
  
Question 3
b) What does the stroke aesthetic do? What shapes does it work with?
```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg)+
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy),shape=18,stroke=1)
```
Answer: shape use different type shapes and stoke used to increase or decrease the thickness of the border.

Question 4
Read? Facet_wrap. What does nrow do? What does ncol do? What other options
control the layout of the individual panels? Why doesn’t facet_grid() have nrow and
ncol variables?

Answer:  faced grid do not have these configuration because the row and columns are determined by the specified attributes

```{r}
?facet_wrap
```
Question 5
a) What plots does the following code make? What does . do?

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
facet_grid(drv ~ .)

ggplot(data = mpg) +
geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
facet_grid(. ~ cyl)
```


b) When using facet_grid() you should usually put the variable with more unique
levels in the columns. Why?

Answer: 
    facet_grid divides the plot in the particular area. That used to make plot into subplot. it gives the meaningful graph.

Question 6
What geom would you use to draw a line chart? A boxplot? A histogram? An area chart?
```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg)+
  geom_line(aes(x=displ,y=hwy))
ggplot(data=mpg)+
  geom_boxplot(aes(x=displ,y=hwy))
ggplot(data=mpg)+
  geom_area(aes(x=displ,y=hwy))

```

Question 7
Will these two graphs look different? Why/why not?
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
geom_point() +
geom_smooth()
```

```{r}
ggplot() +
geom_point(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
geom_smooth(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

Answer: No, the two graph looks similar. because  both geom_point() and geom_smooth() use same data and mappings.

Question 8
What does geom_col() do? How is different to geom_bar()?
```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg)+
  geom_bar(mapping=aes(x=class))
```
```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg)+
  geom_col(mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy))
```
Answer: 
  barchart 
  requires only x whereas column chart requires both x and y

Question 9
What is the default geom associated with stat_summary()? How could you rewrite the
previous plot to use that geom function instead of the stat function?
Answer:
  The default geom associated with stat_summary is geom_pointrange.
```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg)+
  geom_pointrange(aes(x=displ,y=hwy),
                  stat="summary",
             fun.ymin=min,
             fun.ymax=max,
             fun=median)

```

Question 10
What does the plot below tell you about the relationship between city and highway
mpg? Why is coord_fixed() important? What does geom_abline() do?
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping =aes(x =cty, y =hwy)) +
geom_point() +
geom_abline() +
coord_fixed()
```
Answer: 
City milage increases when the highway milage increases 
There is a positive relation between city and highway.
    coord_fixed(): adjust the value in the data set
    geom_abline():it show the prediction between x and y. It shows regression line
